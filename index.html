    <p>he aim of organizing debate competition was to hone the public speaking skills of the students and teach them to be articulate while expressing their thoughts and opinions. The session was the kaleidoscope of opinions, thoughts and perspective that enhanced the knowledge and understanding about the cashless economy among students.

      To begin with, each participant spoke their mind on the rationale for, the execution of and the potential future effects of cashless economy. Unsurprisingly, this led to a wide spectrum of contrasting views – from being heralded as an inevitable future, to being poorly perceived positivity and doubtful future due to a severe lack of critical infrastructure and technology, to being an achievable dream that can lead to a more transparent economy and a possibility of less corrupt India.</p>
